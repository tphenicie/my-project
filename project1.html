        <h2>Mobile Communications Server</h2>
        <p>For this project I created a mobile communications server that fits securely inside of small form factor pelican case.<r>
           <br> Users are able to connect to the server accross a software defined network solution called ZeroTier.
           <br> The server was built using a Raspberry Pi 4 with Ubuntu server and an application called TAK server.
           <br> TAK server provides a graphical interface that shows where each user is located on a map and provides a chat service.
           <br> In addition to the server, a GLI router was installed with a four port switch to allow for radio integration on the server.
           <br> The radio intergration will suport mesh networking radios that extend the use of the server to devices without internet connectivity.
